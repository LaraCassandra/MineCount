<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

* Made use of both `HTML` and `Bootstrap` to create and design the frontend.
* Used C# to implement an `HTTP web server` to dynamically and statically display web pages.
* Made use of `Classes and Objects` to hold infomation of the blocks, recipes and functions to perform the necessary actions.
* `MVC` architecture was used as the structure for the development structure.
* The database was implemented with `MySQL`

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* A fun and `exciting theme` since I enjoy playing Minecraft
* Being able to `parse information` through to the frontend from the database in an effective and appealing way.
* Improving the `UI` to look more appealing and usable.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Attempting to have the ability to craft items from their card tile.
* The recipes functionality in general.
* Continued confusion towards the concepts of `OOP`.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Be able to `craft` a recipe straight from the item card (if applicable).
* `Connect the tracker` straight to Minecraft to directly track inventory.
* Add `categories` to find items better.
